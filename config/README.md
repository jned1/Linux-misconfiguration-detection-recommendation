# Configuration Profiles

This directory contains configuration files used by the detection engine.

## Contents

- benchmark_profiles.yaml → Defines benchmark levels (e.g., CIS Level 1, Level 2)
- thresholds.yaml → Defines detection thresholds and rule parameters

## Purpose

Separating configuration from code allows:

- Easy rule adjustments
- Profile-based scanning
- Reduced hardcoding
