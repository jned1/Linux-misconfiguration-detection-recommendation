# Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation related to the Linux Misconfiguration Detection and Recommendation Framework.

## Purpose

The documentation explains:

- System architecture
- Threat model
- Benchmark alignment (CIS/NIST)
- Remediation design strategy
- Experimental setup

## Files

- architecture.md → Describes internal system design and component interaction.
- threat-model.md → Explains risks caused by Linux misconfigurations.
- benchmark-mapping.md → Maps implemented checks to CIS benchmarks.
- remediation-strategy.md → Explains how recommendations are generated.
- screenshots/ → Optional visual documentation.

## Goal

This folder transforms the project from a script into a structured security engineering framework.
